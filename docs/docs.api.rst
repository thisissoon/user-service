Api docs
========

The user service uses `django-allauth` and `django-rest-auth`. All endpoints_
are generated by `django-rest-auth` and some additional logic is applied.

The api uri is `api/v1/` and only one oauth privider is exposed as default `api/v1/facebook`

.. _endpoints: http://django-rest-auth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_endpoints.html


Examples
--------

Getting user details without authorization token:

 .. code-block:: bash

    http http://localdocker:8000/api/v1/user/

    HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
    Allow: GET, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
    Content-Type: application/json
    Date: Tue, 13 Oct 2015 16:08:37 GMT
    Server: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.10
    Vary: Accept
    WWW-Authenticate: Token
    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN

    {
        "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
    }


Send the same request but with valid authorization token:

 .. code-block:: bash

    http http://localdocker:8000/api/v1/user/  "Authorization: Token 04ad1f8c93bfbdd70ad21bff1ba8c21f165dae0f"

    HTTP/1.0 200 OK

    {
        "email": "user@mail.com",
        "first_name": "user",
